## Instructions: How to play

By clicking on any card, you will see its picture. Then try to find its match underneath the other cards by clicking on a second one. If they match, they will stay visible, if they don’t, the symbols will be hidden again. But be sure to hurry up – a timer is running and your moves are being counted! And less moves mean a better rating!

## Facts

* 8 sets of matching cards: makes a total of 16 cards
* The moves (any opened two cards) will be counted
* The timer is starting on the first click
* A star rating (1 to 3) will be displayed according to the amount of moves used

## Resources

While working on the project, I looked for a nice timer to use… I found one on:

and of course the P3 FEND Study Jam material helped me a lot, e.g. with the "first click":
